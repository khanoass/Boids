# Boids
A C++ simulation about bird like objects

It is made in SFML 2.5.1.

This is my implementation of "Boids", or flocks of bird-like objects. Some sliders are there to adjust the behaviour of those objects, they are in french though.
You can add obstacles by left-clicking in the world, and edit them right-clicking on them afterwards. Press Delete to erase an obstacle and the arrow keys to move it.

This implementation is totally homemade and some bugs or weird behaviour are to be expected.

Have fun!
